# MA12 - HeadAboveWater (H.A.W) - Staying Safe in the Water
## Introduction
Our Website aims to spread prevent risks of drowning near the rock shelves by spreading awareness and giving safety knowledge to the users who tend to go there. We hope that our website takes part in making rock shelf visiting a memorable experience rather than a life-threatening accident.
## Problem Statement
Coastal rock shelves are not only a place to have fun and enjoy nature but also have been proven to be one of the riskiest places in Victoria. Over 13 people are washed off by waves every year where Victoria is the third largest state in terms of deaths. The majority of the victims are males aged around 45 years, rock fishers. Furthermore, there is a six-fold increase in 2019/20 compared to the 10 year average from 2009/10-2018/19 where Autumn is the riskiest season with 30% of the total incidents. These incidents majorly happen between 2-6 PM due to an unsafe environment, lack of proper safety equipment and sometimes alcohol. This issue can be diminished by bringing more awareness to the community and giving them a danger alert beforehand.
